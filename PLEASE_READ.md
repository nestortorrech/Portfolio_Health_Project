Exploratory Data Analysis on 2014 Medicare and Obesity statistics

The Excels files included are modified to only include data I was planning on using. Here, as well as in the SQL file,
I shall include the original links for those interested.

Medicare Data: https://data.world/adamhelsinger/county-state-medicare-spend

Obesity Data: https://data.world/health/obesity-by-state-2014

Population Data: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2014/demo/saipe/2014-state-and-county.html

Again, thank you for your time. I also wish to reiterate that this is data from 2014, and this was just a small hobby project
to test out my SQL Data Exploration skills. So take any and all findings with a grain of salt, but I hope you enjoy
